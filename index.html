      <h3>Introduction: What <i>is</i> Funky Trees?</h3>
        <p>When you do things in SimplePlanes, like controlling your plane by moving the joystick or pressing the keyboard, essentially what you're doing is you're sending a signal to the various functional bits on your plane to move as you told it to. Funky Trees expands the options you can have here and allows for much more complex programming of the inputs to allow for very special input programming to allow creation of incredibly powerful and useful parts.
        </p>
        <p>
        	By nature, Funky Trees is a special subfield of what's known as XML editing/modding in SimplePlanes. If you aren't familar with basic XML editing, there is absolutely no way you will understand the workings of funky trees- you must learn that first.
